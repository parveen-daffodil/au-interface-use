## Purchases and payments

If your Service allows or requires the Customer to make purchases from you or make payments to you, you should specify the details of how these purchases or payments can take place. If your Service does not involve the Customer making purchases from you, or payments to you, feel free to delete this clause entirely.

### Purchases T&Cs

PATXXX - This is the big drafting element for this document. We have a payment methods and payment calculation module. But they're not really designed for this. Realistically, this should probably be several clauses, each small enough to be split into a module. This is a chunk we should talk about I think, because it could cover retail situations we haven't really hit yet.

- Terms of sale
- Payment methods
- puchasing garuntees
- Deliveries of products
- Cancellation of Orders
- Returns and Exchanges
- Try to generically cover in app purchases here too.
- NOT TRYING TO CUT OUT STATUTORY RIGHTS UNDER CONSUMER LAW I TOTALLY PROMISE GUYS
- Above element covered by lawpatch boilerplate, right?

## Unnaceptable Activity

If your Service allows your Customer to post content to the Service, or to communicate with other users of the service, it's a good idea to be clear that there are limits to what kind of content is acceptable.

### Customer agrees to use the service in an acceptable manner

Customer agrees that use of the Service is limited to what Contractor deems to be acceptable. Customer agrees not to use the Service in any way that is unnaceptable to the contractor, including:

PATXXX - this list should probably be a widget.

- The posting of racist content, or hate speech
- The posting of computer viruses, or trojans
- Anything illegal

## Warranties

Your service may provide information to the Customer. This clause makes it clear that you can not absolutely garuntee the accuracy of this information.

### No Warrenty

PATXXX

While all due care has been taken, information from the Service is not warrentied to be either exhaustive or accurate.


## Indemnity

## Limitation of Liability

## Posted Content Provision

PATXXX - I rolled the posted content provision and the "not responsible for links to third party sites" together here. They seem to serve a similar purpose. We probably also want an option where Customer grants Contractor a license to all the content they post to the service. Ugh.

### Contractor does not accept responsibility for user content
Responsibility for posted content lies with the Customer, not the Contractor. Where Contractor has posted links to third party sites, Contractor is not responsible for the content on those sites.


## Two sided market 

If your service facilitates commercial interaction between other parties (e.g. an auction site), you may wish to specify the level of your obligations to settle disputes between these parties. If your Service does not facilitate commercial interaction between other parties, feel free to delete this clause entirely.

### Contractor has no obligation to resolve disputes

PATXXX

 Contractor facilitates commercial interaction between different Customers, but has no connection to the services exchanged between Customers. Customers have an obligation to make a good faith effort to resolve conflicts between themselves and other Customers without the intervention of the Contractor.
