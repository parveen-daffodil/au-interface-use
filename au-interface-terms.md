## Digital accounts

## Two sided market

If the service facilitates commercial interaction between people (e.g. an auction site like eBay), it's a good idea to specify what the involvement of the service provider is. If your Service does not facilitate commercial interaction between other parties, feel free to delete this topic entirely.  

### Contractor is not involved with transactions and agreements between users of the Services.

- Contractor facilitates commercial transactions between users of the Service, but has no relationship at law with the transactions between users of the Service.
- Customer agrees to make a good faith effort to resolve conflicts between itself and any other user of the Service without the intervention of the Contractor.

## Purchases and payments

When a provider sells products as part of providing a Service (online shopping for example), it's obviously a good idea for everyone to be clear on the terms of the product sale.  This applies to goods (physical products) and intangible products (like digital music) etc.

### Purchases T&Cs

- Terms of sale
- Payment methods
- purchasing garuntees
- Deliveries of products
