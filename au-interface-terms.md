# Interface Terms

`Purpose` This document template creates terms and conditions to use a website or a mobile device app.

`Party 1 Name` Provider

`Party 2 Name` User

`Jurisdiction` Australia

## Agreement

This document describes an agreement between a website / app provider and its user.

### User creates the Agreement by using the Service.

User agrees to the terms of the Agreement by using the Service.

## Access to Service

### User access to the Service is on the terms of the Agreement.

Provider will allow User to access and use the Service, subject to the terms of the Agreement.

## Age Restrictions

You may want to limit children's access. If you don't want any age restrictions, just delete this topic.

### Only adults can use the Service.

User promises that he or she is over 18 years of age by using the Service.

### Non adults above a certain age can use the Service with supervision.

User must be 18 years old or over to use of the Service, unless:
- User is at least {{minimum age}} years old; and
- uses the Service with the permission and supervision of a guardian.

User's parent or legal guardian agrees that they will supervise User's use of the Service.

## Digital accounts

## Two sided market

If users do business with each other on the service (e.g. an auction site like eBay), it's good to be clear that deals are between the users only, without involving the service provider. If your Service is not a platform that allows users to do business with each other, feel free to delete this topic entirely.

### Provider is not involved with transactions and agreements between users of the Services.

- {{party 1}} facilitates commercial transactions between users of the Service, but has no relationship at law with the transactions between users of the Service.
- User agrees to make a good faith effort to resolve conflicts between itself and any other user of the Service without the intervention of {{party 1}}.

## Product purchases

When a provider sells products as part of providing a Service (online shopping for example), it's obviously a good idea for everyone to be clear on the terms of the product sale.  This applies to goods (physical products) and intangible products (like digital music) etc.

### No refunds for Product purchases.

{{party 2}} agrees:
- to pay {{party 1}} the amounts listed by {{party 1}} in exchange for the Products;
- to pay {{party 1}} for the Products using the payment method specified by the User on the Services;
- {{party 1}} may decline an order for a Product at its discretion and will provide a full refund for any declined order; and
- otherwise {{refund policy}}.

## Product delivery

If you deliver products, it's good to be clear when customers become responsible, and when they get ownership. If you don't deliver products, feel free to delete this topic.

### Responsibility passes on delivery, ownership passes on payment.

User agrees that:
- the Products are the responsibility of {{party 2}} when they reach the delivery address; and
- that the Products remain the property of {{party 1}} until {{party 2}} has paid {{party 1}} for the Products in full.
