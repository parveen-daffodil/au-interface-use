## Agreement

This document describes an agreement between a website / app provider and its user.

### User creates the Agreement by using the Service.

User agrees to the terms of the Agreement by using the Service.

## Age Restrictions

You may wish to have age restrictions to limit the access of non-adults to the service. If you do not wish to have any sort of age restrictions at all, just delete this topic.

### Only adults can use the Service.

User promises that he or she is over 18 years of age by using the Service.

### Non adults above a certain age can use the Service with supervision.

User must be 18 years old or over to use of the Service, unless:

## Two sided market

If the service facilitates commercial interaction between people (e.g. an auction site like eBay), it's a good idea to specify what the involvement of the service provider is. If your Service does not facilitate commercial interaction between other parties, feel free to delete this topic entirely.

### Provider is not involved with transactions and agreements between users of the Services.

- Provider facilitates commercial transactions between users of the Service, but has no relationship at law with the transactions between users of the Service.
- User agrees to make a good faith effort to resolve conflicts between itself and any other user of the Service without the intervention of the Provider.

## Product purchases

When a provider sells products as part of providing a Service (online shopping for example), it's obviously a good idea for everyone to be clear on the terms of the product sale.  This applies to goods (physical products) and intangible products (like digital music) etc.

### No refunds for Product purchases.

User agrees:

- to pay Provider the amounts listed by the Provider in exchange for the Products;
- to pay Provider for the Products using the payment method specified by the User on the Services; and
- that, to the fullest extent available under the law, refunds are not allowed.

## Product delivery

User agrees that:

- Provider may decline an order for a Product at its discretion and will provide a full refund for any declined order;
- the Products are the responsibility of the Provider when they reach the delivery address; and
- that the Products remain the property of Provider until the User has paid the Provider for the Products in full.
