## Two sided market

If the service facilitates commercial interaction between people (e.g. an auction site like eBay), it's a good idea to specify what the involvement of the service provider is. If your Service does not facilitate commercial interaction between other parties, feel free to delete this topic entirely.

### Contractor is not involved with transactions and agreements between users of the Services.

- Contractor facilitates commercial transactions between users of the Service, but has no relationship at law with the transactions between users of the Service.
- Customer agrees to make a good faith effort to resolve conflicts between itself and any other user of the Service without the intervention of the Contractor.

## Product purchases

When a provider sells products as part of providing a Service (online shopping for example), it's obviously a good idea for everyone to be clear on the terms of the product sale.  This applies to goods (physical products) and intangible products (like digital music) etc.

### No refunds for Product purchases.  

Customer agrees:

- to pay Contractor the amounts listed by the Contractor in exchange for the Products;
- to pay Contractor for the Products using the payment method specified by the Customer on the Services; and
- that, to the fullest extent available under the law, refunds are not allowed.

## Product delivery

Customer agrees that:

- Contractor may decline an order for a Product at its discretion and will provide a full refund for any declined order;
- the Products are the responsibility of the Contractor when they reach the delivery address; and
- that the Products remain the property of Contractor until the Customer has paid the Contractor for the Products in full.
